                            For my Senior Capstone Design project, a team of fellow students and I are working with The Coca Cola Company on a project which utilizes Machine Learning models to better predict the performance of marketing campaigns before they are released, and to identify what traits of an advertisement make it succesful. We have finished the architecture planning phase and are moving into the implementation phase currently.

                           For my Machine Learning for Trading class, our final project assignment was to create a Q-Learning trading agent. It was really interesting to see the times that the Q-Learner decided to enter and exit positions, and I learned a great deal about reinforcement learning from this project (and class). The project was written in Python and explored the reinforcement learning concept of hallucination.

I was very excited for this position since I got to work on machine learning models with a good amount of creative freedom (The Home Depot was a fantastic employer in this sense). I worked closely with Open NLP, Tensorflow, Google Cloud Platform and wrote all models in Python. The task I worked on was to evaluate and improve spell correction for thehomedepot.com's search engine. It was a very though provoking project and I enjoyed working on it very much. I learned a great deal about how to efficiently train ML models in the cloud, clean and format data, and formulate data pipelines.</p>

My project revolved around creating software that helped control routers, set top boxes and modems; specifically in handling large volumes of traffic and pulling data for offline analysis. At this point in my college career I had taken a few systems and networking courses and wanted to get some professional experience in this area, since I was still finishing prerequisistes for the AI and ML classes I wanted to take. This internship was my first experience to Go language, which I found really interesting and impressive with its concurrent programming power and documentation. I also worked with Couchbase to store the traffic information, the first database system I really enjoyed working with.</p>

It being my first internship as a software developer, I made many mistakes but learned an immense amount. We were working on a media monitoring platform, so I learned a ton about server side programming, front and back end web development, database management and parallel computing, and, although it didn't work well at first, Jon and I eventually figured out the Agile methodologies in practice the way every one of our developer friends and professors talked about them in theory. This was also the first time I learned the ins and outs of a framework, Ruby on Rails. I enjoyed this experience tremendously and look back on it fondly as the beginning of my learning curve with software engineering and development.&nbsp;</p>
